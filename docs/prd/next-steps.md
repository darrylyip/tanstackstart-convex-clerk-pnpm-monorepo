# Next Steps

**For Design Architect:**
Review UI/UX specifications in Epic 4 (Physician Portal) and Epic 3 (Admin Dashboard) to create detailed wireframes and design system specifications. Pay special attention to mobile-first physician portal design and advertising integration that maintains professional healthcare aesthetics.

**For Architect:**
Review technical assumptions and service architecture to validate the three-repository approach with shared authentication and Convex backend. Assess AI scheduling engine integration requirements and calendar API constraints that may impact system design.

**For Development Team:**
Begin with Epic 1 (Multi-Tenant Foundation) to establish core infrastructure, then prioritize Epic 2 (Admin Dashboard & Organization Setup) and Epic 3 (Physician Portal) for MVP delivery. Epic 4 (Profile Photo Management) can only begin after both admin and physician portals exist. Epic 7 (Advertising Infrastructure) should be integrated early to validate revenue model assumptions.

**For Product Team:**
Prepare pilot program recruitment and advertiser relationship development while development progresses. Focus on ROI metrics collection and preference analytics that will support enterprise sales conversations.
