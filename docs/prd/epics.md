# Epics

## Epic 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation & Authentication
**Epic Goal:** Establish secure multi-tenant architecture with shared authentication across admin and web applications.

**Epic Background:** Both admin and web users need seamless access to their organization's data while maintaining strict data isolation between different healthcare organizations. The foundation must support future enterprise SSO integration and HIPAA-compliance requirements.

## Epic 2: Admin Dashboard & Organization Setup
**Epic Goal:** Create comprehensive admin dashboard with guided organization setup wizard, enabling schedule coordinators to configure departments, shifts, constraints, and track key performance metrics.

**Epic Background:** New organizations need foundational configuration before scheduling can begin. The setup process must be fast enough for trials but flexible enough for complex hospital structures. Schedule administrators currently spend 15-20 hours monthly creating schedules manually, requiring AI-powered generation with healthcare constraint handling.

## Epic 3: AI Schedule Generation Engine
**Epic Goal:** Implement the core AI-powered scheduling intelligence that automatically generates optimal physician schedules while respecting complex healthcare constraints, physician preferences, and holiday staffing requirements.

**Epic Background:** This is the platform's primary differentiator - the AI engine that transforms 15-20 hours of manual schedule creation into automated generation with superior constraint satisfaction. The system must integrate multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) for reliability, handle complex healthcare scheduling rules, and optimize across multiple objectives including fairness, preference accommodation, and operational efficiency. This epic represents the core value proposition that justifies hospital adoption and physician satisfaction.

## Epic 4: Web Portal & User Experience
**Epic Goal:** Provide physicians with mobile-friendly access to schedules, PTO management, preference tracking, and personal analytics.

**Epic Background:** Physicians need instant mobile access to schedules and transparent visibility into how their preferences are being accommodated. The portal must provide self-service capabilities while maintaining simplicity for users with varying technical skills.

## Epic 5: Profile Photo Management System
**Epic Goal:** Enable physicians to upload and manage profile photos that display consistently across admin and web applications.

**Epic Background:** Profile photos improve the human connection in physician scheduling and help administrators quickly identify physicians in schedule views. The system must handle image optimization, CDN delivery, and shared access across applications. This epic depends on both admin dashboard and physician portal being established.

## Epic 6: Calendar Integration & External Sync
**Epic Goal:** Provide seamless bi-directional calendar synchronization with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar, ensuring physicians never miss shifts due to calendar conflicts.

**Epic Background:** Manual calendar entry leads to missed shifts and double-bookings. Automatic synchronization must create separate VECTR0 calendars to avoid conflicts while maintaining real-time updates when schedules change.

## Epic 7: Preference Analytics & Reporting
**Epic Goal:** Implement comprehensive preference tracking and analytics to demonstrate fairness, accommodation rates, and ROI value for hospital purchasing decisions.

**Epic Background:** Preference fulfillment transparency is a key differentiator that drives physician satisfaction. Analytics must provide both individual feedback and administrative insights that justify the platform's value proposition.

## Epic 8: Advertising Infrastructure & Monetization
**Epic Goal:** Implement tasteful, targeted advertising system that generates revenue from the premium physician audience while maintaining professional user experience.

**Epic Background:** The advertising-supported model requires premium CPM rates from healthcare advertisers. Ad integration must be non-intrusive and relevant to physician audiences while providing comprehensive analytics for advertiser value demonstration.

## Epic 9: Data Migration & Legacy System Integration
**Epic Goal:** Provide comprehensive data migration and legacy system integration capabilities that enable hospitals to transition from existing scheduling systems to VECTR0 with minimal disruption and maximum data preservation.

**Epic Background:** Hospitals currently use a variety of scheduling systems ranging from Excel spreadsheets to specialized EMR scheduling modules. Successful VECTR0 adoption requires seamless migration of historical schedules, physician data, and existing constraints while maintaining operational continuity during transition. The system must handle diverse data formats, validate migrated data integrity, and provide rollback capabilities for risk mitigation.

## Epic 10: Performance & Scalability Infrastructure
**Epic Goal:** Build enterprise-grade performance and scalability infrastructure that supports hospitals from 10 to 1,000+ physicians while maintaining sub-second response times and 99.9% uptime requirements.

**Epic Background:** Hospital scheduling systems are mission-critical infrastructure that cannot afford downtime or slow performance. The system must scale seamlessly from small practices to major hospital networks, handle peak usage during quarterly schedule generation, and maintain consistent performance across global deployments. Performance issues directly impact physician satisfaction and hospital operational efficiency.
