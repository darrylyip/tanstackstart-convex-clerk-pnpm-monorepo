The PRD maintains focus on the MVP scope while establishing foundation for post-MVP features like mobile apps, marketplace functionality, and HIPAA compliance certification. Holiday management addresses a critical operational need that prevents both understaffing (safety risk) and overstaffing (cost waste) during holidays while ensuring fair distribution of holiday work among physicians.
