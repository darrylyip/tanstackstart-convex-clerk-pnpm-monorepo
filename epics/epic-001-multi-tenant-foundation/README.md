# Epic 001: Multi-Tenant Foundation & Authentication

## Overview
This epic establishes the secure multi-tenant architecture that forms the foundation of the VECTR0 platform, enabling shared authentication across admin and web applications while maintaining strict data isolation.

## Epic Status
- **Status:** NOT_STARTED
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Stories:** 0 total (0 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending)

## Epic Goal
Establish secure multi-tenant architecture with shared authentication across admin and web applications.

## Background
Both admin and web users need seamless access to their organization's data while maintaining strict data isolation between different healthcare organizations. The foundation must support future enterprise SSO integration and HIPAA-compliance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation implemented
- [ ] Shared authentication system operational
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) configured
- [ ] Organization context management working
- [ ] Session management across applications
- [ ] Security audit logging enabled

## Key Technical Components
1. **Database Multi-tenancy**
   - Row-level security (RLS)
   - Organization ID partitioning
   - Query isolation

2. **Authentication System**
   - JWT token management
   - Refresh token strategy
   - Session handling

3. **Authorization Framework**
   - Role definitions
   - Permission matrices
   - Resource access control

4. **Security Infrastructure**
   - Audit logging
   - Security headers
   - CORS configuration

## Dependencies
- Database infrastructure setup
- Authentication provider selection (Auth0/Supabase/Custom)
- Security compliance requirements documentation

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data leakage between tenants | CRITICAL | Implement RLS, automated testing, security audits |
| Authentication complexity | HIGH | Use proven auth provider, extensive testing |
| Performance impact | MEDIUM | Query optimization, caching strategies |

## Story Breakdown
Stories will be added as they are created. Use the Scrum Master agent to create stories for this epic.

## Notes
This is the foundational epic that must be completed before other features can be built. It establishes the security and multi-tenancy patterns that all other epics will follow.
